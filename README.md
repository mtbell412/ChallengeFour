# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

I created a code quiz template using an array of objects with a question bank. Each question bank contains options the administrator can change with the corresponding answer. When the user enters the incorrect answer the score has a timer that removes 15 seconds. At the end the user can enter their name or initals to get stored in local storage. If the users name is the same it will overwrite their previous highscore. Once the last index of the array is reached the game is over or if the time runs out the game is over. Enjoy!
